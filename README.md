## A Commercial Recommendation Engine: Using Generative AI to Recommend Best Suited Readily Available Commodities to Daily Shoppers from All the Surrounding Superstores in A Particular Region
### About
A comprehensive recommendation engine which is built on Generative AI to serve some crucial e-commerce oriented needs with personalized suggestions for shoppers on a daily basis. Using Large Language Model with customer centric dataset and self-supervised learning, this recommendation engine will interact with users according to their requirements and generate tailored recommendations analyzing browsing history, purchase behavior, preferences, and interactions with the platform. This will be an updated version of usual recommendation engine due to the incorporation of novel Generative AI technology. The engine will not only recommend optimum solutions but also understand the context of user queries and respond accordingly. This is a handy tool which will perform as a companion to reduce human effort and time significantly and facilitate commercial growth by increasing user engagement and retention, improving user satisfaction and boosting sales and revenue of the registered general stores both from marketing and sales perspectives.

### Workflow
Creating a commercial recommendation engine that leverages generative AI to recommend readily available commodities to daily shoppers from surrounding superstores in a specific region is a complex but feasible project.
